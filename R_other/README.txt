This folder is for miscellaneous files that are related to the radio project, and are only in
this repository for completeness' sake.

Files and folders in this folder (R_other):

schematic_final_WVFZMbBmqV.jpg
    Schematic file we were considering using with the TEF6686 radio module.
    From https://www.instructables.com/Simple-TEF6686-Arduino-PC-AM-FM-Radio-Receiver/ 

ArduinoIdeas.txt
    Notes document used very early on in the project to organize ideas. This file was created
    before the radio idea was decided upon, so there are also other ideas listed.

Radio.ino.txt
    Code from Kevin Darrah's YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1hPj2wfsnA, which 
    was used mostly as-is for this project. This video also served as inspiration for this
    project. In the video, Kevin Darrah mentions that this specific snippet of code was from
    Simon Monk's TEA5767 library (linked in this repsoitory's README).

ArduinoHardwareInstructions.docx
    Instructions document made so that everyone in the team would know how to wire up the
    radio components.

SlideshowImages/
    Folder of the images that were used in the slideshow found in R_slideshow.

CircuitDiagramImages/
    Folder of images used for the circuit diagram found in R_resources. Also contains the links 
    to all images in the circuit diagram.

ProgressVideos/
    Videos sent by James to the rest of the group when various progress throughout the semester
    was made. Real professional-grade videos with exceptional production quality. Also includes
    a couple of videos recorded by Claudio in the physics lab showcasing the radio working.
