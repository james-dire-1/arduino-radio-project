schematic_final_WVFZMbBmqV.jpg
    Schematic file we were considering using with the TEF6686 radio module.

ArduinoIdeas.txt
    Notes document used very early on in the project to organize ideas. This file was created
    before the radio idea was decided upon, so there are also other ideas listed.

HardwareLinks.txt
    Comprehensive list of hardware for the project along with respective links.

Radio.ino.txt
    Code written by Kevin Darrah from the YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1hPj2wfsnA,
    which was used mostly as-is for this project. This video also served as inspiration for this
    project.

ArduinoHardwareInstructions.docx
    Instructions document made so that everyone in the team would know how to wire up the
    radio components.

ProgressVideos/
    Videos sent by James to the rest of the group when various progress throughout the semester
    was made. Real professional-grade videos with exceptional production quality.
