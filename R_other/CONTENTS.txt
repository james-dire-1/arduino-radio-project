ArduinoIdeas.txt
    Notes document used very early on in the project to organize ideas. This file was created
    before the radio idea was decided upon, so there are also other ideas listed.

HardwareLinks.txt
    Comprehensive list of hardware for the project along with respective links.

Radio.ino.txt
    Code written by Kevin Darrah from the YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1hPj2wfsnA,
